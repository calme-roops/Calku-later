# Cal-u-later

Man, This project was quite difficult as I just started getting into learning Js. But the great part is I made it through bu learning JavaScript DOM, algorithms, functions and what not.

It is worth to mention that Js is awesome and I fell in love with it. Also learn about different CSS properties like `transform`, `transition`,etc. The calculator(I prefer to call it, calku-later :wink:) has both mouse and keyboard functionality.
